        <h3>Web Design and Software Development</h3>
        <p class="code">I have been developing since I was 15 because I wanted to kickstart my own company, and over time aim to become a full-stack developer that makes computer and phone applications. I was first introduced with HTML and CSS, before moving onto javascript and mysql. Before I knew it, I was beginning to develop my first app through SwiftUI. Nothing gives me a thrill quite like the moment the code that didnt work for 10 hours <em>works</em>.</p>

        <h3>Reading</h3>
        <p class="network">I love reading in my spare time. For a while I was really pushed away from it but it is never a bad time to escape reality for a few hours... or days with a good read.</p>

        <h3>Learning</h3>
        <p class="code"> Speaking of being a bookworm, I am always learning. I'm studying a double degree in Information Technology and Business full-time, whilst always picking up a new programming language to familiarise myself with. Currently I am also undergoing the<a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-automation" target="_blank">Google Coursera IT Automation with Python</a>course, as well as making my way through a multitude of Udemy iOS courses to help me build my apps and projects to the best of my abilities.</p>
